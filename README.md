# RNA_seq_breastcancer
Repository for the documented code used for the analysis in the course "RNA-sequencing".

Project 1: Characterise gene expression differences between human breast cancer subtypes
# 1. Work on the IBU cluster
The following steps were performed on the IBU cluster in Bern:
- Quality control
- Mapping of reads to reference genome
- Converting SAM to BAM files
- Counting the number of reads per gene
  
All the scripts for the steps above can be found attached as .sh files.
The samplelist that was used for running the SLURM-Arrays is also attached.

# 2. Work on the local machine
The following steps were carried out on the local machine of the student in R-Studio:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Differetntial gene exrpession analysis
- Overrepresentation analyis

The R-script for the steps above is attached as well.
